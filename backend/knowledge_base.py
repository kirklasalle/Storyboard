"""
Cinematic Knowledge Base — The Second Brain of Storyboard AI.

A dynamic, self-growing repository of cinematic wisdom that accumulates
knowledge from every script analyzed, every storyboard generated, and every
visual pattern observed. It preserves the integrity of:

  — Cinema and its visual grammar
  — Storytelling and narrative architecture
  — Journalism and factual authenticity
  — Production values and professional craft
  — The authentic voice of every genre

The KB learns from processed material, enriches future analyses with
accumulated domain wisdom, and serves as the institutional memory of the
Storyboard AI system.

Architecture:
  - SQLite-backed persistent knowledge entries
  - LLM-powered insight extraction from each analysis batch
  - Semantic tagging and cross-referencing by genre/style/theme
  - Usage tracking (which insights prove most valuable)
  - Confidence scoring and temporal decay for stale knowledge
