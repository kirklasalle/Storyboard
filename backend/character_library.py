"""
Character Library — The Institutional Memory of Storyboard AI.

A growing, self-enriching database of character archetypes, visual profiles,
and voice assignments that accumulates across every project analyzed.

Scale:
  - No practical limit on character count (SQLite handles millions)
  - ~4KB per character record → 1M characters ≈ 4GB
  - Practical working library: 5,000–50,000 unique archetypes
  - Performance: sub-millisecond lookups up to ~100,000 records

Taxonomy: 4 dimensions, ~14,000 distinct type combinations
  - Narrative Role     (14 types)
  - Jungian Archetype (12 types)
  - Production Tier    (6 types)
  - Genre Type        (14 types)

Growth Model:
  First use   → Foundational archetypes seeded
  Per project → Named characters extracted, profiled, persisted
  Per batch   → Archetypes distilled and added to global library
  Next project → Library enriches new character profiles automatically
